Hello, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jenny Lin and recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and Economics. In this portfolio, I have included projects using programming languages Python and SQL. Through the projects, I aim to showecase my ability in conducting data analysis and application of data science techniques. 

## [Autonomous Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/tree/3e21906c027e1fee7ffe6c8c1e4bb8a9552a1996/Autonomous%20Vehicle%20Trajectory%20Prediction)
* Preprocessed PIL images and extracted target values from CSV file for preparing custom dataset.
* Generated training and testing data for custom neural network using Dataloader from Pytorch library. 
* Designed and trained a Regression model resulting final accuracy of 7% using training and augmented data. 

## [Sentiment Classification on Yelp User Reviews](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/tree/3e21906c027e1fee7ffe6c8c1e4bb8a9552a1996/Sentiment%20Classification)
* Cleaned yelp user and business datasets and filtering for restaurants only reviews and verifying for 
* Employed pipeline using custom text transformer and TF-IDF for determining best estimator.
* Finetuned hyperparameters using Randomized Search and achieving a test accuracy of 83.79%.

## [Walmart Sales Analysis](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/tree/3e21906c027e1fee7ffe6c8c1e4bb8a9552a1996/Walmart%20Sales)
* Measured effects of holiday, cpi, and unemployment on consumer behavior using joins, multiple CTEs, window functions.
* Compared annual sales by percentage change and evaluated sales trend based on monthly sales.
