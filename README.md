Hello, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jenny Lin and currently a senior double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Economics. In this portfolio, I have included personal projects using programming languages Python and SQL. In addition, I use Tableau and Matplotlib for presenting data trends and insights in a more appealing and conspicuous way. Through the projects, I aim to showecase my ability in conducting data analysis and application of data science techniques. 

## [Analyzing Sales of Chip Brands](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/blob/main/salesProject.ipynb)
* Cleaned and wrangled transaction data, i.e, removed outliers, filtered out irrelevant products, and generalized brand names for consistency.
* Merged transaction and customer data for analyzing purchasing behavior and preferences.
* Visualized transactions bsed on customer demographics and customer type using Matplotlib.

## [Media Campaign Cost Prediction](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/blob/main/ML.ipynb)
* Analyzed training data using confusion matrix and preprocessed the data such as dropping low correlated columns and creating new features based on existing data.
* Trained and employed Gradient Boosting Regressor model using Scikit-Learn for predicting the target cost of media campaign.
* Minimized Root Mean Squared Log Error through KFold algorithm and feature engineering, achieving final score of 29.83%.

## [Understanding Global COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/jxlinnn/jxlinnn.github.io/blob/main/ML.ipynb)
* Filtered data to discover countries with leading infection rate, death rates, and other statistics using PostgreSQL.
* Mapped out countries to their corresponding vaccination rate using temporary table and joins.
